// note that if the sanitize.go changes, we will need to update the tests in CamelKJSONUtils.ts
// and we will need to re-stash the sanitize.go file from github
// it was last stashed on 23-JUL-2019
// to restash, go to the src/test directory and run
// > curl -o sanitize.go https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/camel-k/master/pkg/util/kubernetes/sanitize.go
// then rename the file to "sanitize.go.saved"

// this is not the best solution, but it offers a way to ensure that if things change upstream at least we know when the tests fail
