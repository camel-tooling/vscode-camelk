# Welcome to the Tools for Apache Camel K VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.

## Get up and running straight away

* Open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Extension (vscode-camelk)`.
* You can then press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* The Apache Camel K Integrations view shows up in the Explorer activity sidebar.
* Set breakpoints in your code (such as within `src/extension.ts`) to debug the extension.
* Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Run tests

* Open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Extension Tests (vscode-camelk)`.
* Press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with the extension loaded.
* See the output of the test result in the debug console.
* Make changes to `src/test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `src/test` folder.
  * By convention, the test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  * You can create folders inside the `src/test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.
